# CDCS

`CDCS.jl` is an interface to the **[CDCS](https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/CDCS)**
solver. It exports the `cdcs` function that is a thin wrapper on top of the
`cdcs` MATLAB function and use it to define the `CDCS.Optimizer` object that
implements the solver-independent
[MathOptInterface](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathOptInterface.jl) API.

To use it with [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl), simply do
```julia
using JuMP
using CDCS
model = Model(with_optimizer(CDCS.Optimizer))
```
To suppress output, do
```julia
model = Model(with_optimizer(CDCS.Optimizer, verbose=0))
```

## Installation

You can install `CDCS.jl` through the
[Julia package manager](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/index.html):
```julia
] add https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/CDCS.jl.git
```
but you first need to make sure that you satisfy the requirements of the
[MATLAB.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/MATLAB.jl) Julia package and that
the CDCS software is installed in your
[MATLABâ„¢](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) installation.
